To learn how to use GitHub:
https://guides.github.com/
GitHub is useful because it provides us with a better text editor than Google Docs, it allows us to branch different versions of code off, and then pull them together. And we can save our changes as we go, in moments of time, which allows us to revisit them in case we do something disastrous.
